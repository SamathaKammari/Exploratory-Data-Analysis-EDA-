What is Exploratory Data Analysis?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an important first step in data science projects. It involves looking at and visualizing data to understand its main features, find patterns, and discover how different parts of the data are connected.

EDA helps to spot any unusual data or outliers and is usually done before starting more detailed statistical analysis or building models. In this article, we will discuss what is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the steps to perform EDA.

Why Exploratory Data Analysis is Important?
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is important for several reasons, especially in the context of data science and statistical modeling. Here are some of the key reasons why EDA is a critical step in the data analysis process:

Helps to understand the dataset, showing how many features there are, the type of data in each feature, and how the data is spread out, which helps in choosing the right methods for analysis.
EDA helps to identify hidden patterns and relationships between different data points, which help us in and model building.
Allows to spot errors or unusual data points (outliers) that could affect your results.
Insights that you obtain from EDA help you decide which features are most important for building models and how to prepare them to improve performance.
By understanding the data, EDA helps us in choosing the best modeling techniques and adjusting them for better results.
